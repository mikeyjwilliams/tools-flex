Info

Hi I am Gary and have been working in body shops over 40 years.
I have been in local Bradenton shops for about 25 years. I am selling
off my tools. If you are interested I can provide work place references.
These tools are my own tools, not selling other peoples tools for them so do not ask
Also, These are mostly American made tools, All still usable, many are lightly used,
some even new.
